# Addvice App

## Description


Addvice is a social app that allows users to contribute a random piece of advice in order to receive unlimited, randomized advice and aphorisms submitted by other users.  


## Features

This advice app allows a user to __submit__ , __receive__ , and __save__ content from the main (master) screen. Saved content is stored locally (offline) on the device using core data.

If a user finds any piece of content diplayed objectionable, they can flag it by tapping the "!". An alert view will pop up with the option to permanently __block__ any future content from the offending user.


## Library

* Firebase: Used to create and authenticate user accounts; and remotely stores user submitted content in a database.
